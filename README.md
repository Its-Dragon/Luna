# Luna

Just a fun project I decided to start in my freetime. It's a lua compatible with Aimware's V5 CS:GO LUA API. As of 11/20/21, there is no support for any other LUA API and neither is it planned.

Features:
- Info Window
- Head Dot
- Snaplines
- Edgebug
- Longjump
- Keystrokes Indicator
- Bhop Hitchance
- Door Spam
- Rainbow HUD
- Force Crosshair
- Recoil Crosshair
- Sniper Crosshair
- Inventory Unlock
- Retain Viewmodel
- Enemy FOV Counter
- Multiple Styles & Logos for Info Window
